# 0x01. Basic authentication
# Background Context
In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

# Learning Objectives üìñ
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

## General ‚õ©Ô∏è
* What authentication means
* What Base64 is
* How to encode a string in Base64
* What Basic authentication means
* How to send the Authorization header

# Requirements üèõÔ∏è
## Python Scripts üêç
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
